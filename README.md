Piece-wise Linear Transformation
for Image Enhancement
Introduction:
Piece-wise Linear Transformation is a grayscale transformation technique used
for image enhancement in the spatial domain. It allows the manipulation of an
image to make it more suitable for specific applications. This method is
particularly useful for enhancing contrast.

Task 2 - 
Histogram Equalization for Image
Enhancement
Introduction:
Histogram equalization is a fundamental image processing technique used to
enhance the contrast of an image. It works by redistributing the intensity levels
in an image, which can help in revealing more details and making the image more
visually appealing. In this assignment, you will be required to implement
histogram equalization from scratch using MATLAB.
Description:
Histogram equalization involves modifying the pixel intensities of an image so
that the histogram of the resulting image is as uniform as possible. It enhances
the overall contrast by stretching the intensity range of the image. Your task is
to create a MATLAB function to perform histogram equalization without using
built-in functions for this purpose.


Task 3 -
Gaussian Filtering for blurring and
noise reduction in images
Introduction:
Gaussian filtering is a widely used image processing technique that is crucial for
both image blurring and noise reduction. It operates by applying a Gaussian
kernel to an image, which effectively blurs the image or reduces noise while
preserving important image features. In this task, you will embark on the
implementation of Gaussian filtering from scratch using MATLAB. This will
allow you to grasp the inner workings of this valuable tool for image
enhancement..
